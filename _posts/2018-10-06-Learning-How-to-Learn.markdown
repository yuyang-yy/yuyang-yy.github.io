This Blog is a note for the course on Coursera -- **Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects**. [The transcript file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuyang-yy/materials/master/Learning-how-to-learn.pdf) is also helpful.


## Week 1
There are two different learning modes: **Focused Mode** and **Diffused Mode**. When learning something difficult and new, we need to go back and forth between these two modes, and this will greatly help us learn effectively.

#### Procastination.
Usually, our brain feels the pain of doing one thing and try to switch to something more pleasant. The result is you will be happier, temporarily. Research has shown that not long after you start doing what you don't like, the discomfort would disappear. One tool to help you get started is the Pomodoro -- 25 minutes tool.

#### Practice makes permanent.
The first time we begin to understand something, the neural pattern is very weak. Then we solve this problem again from the start, we could enhance such neural pattern. Later, after the problem has been cold, we go over all the steps again withough looking at the solution and do related problems, then the pattern will be further enhanced. If procrastination comes out, use Pomodoro. Use brief periods of focused attention to help build neural patterns.

For example, after understanding the solution of one MATH 8651 problem, try it from the fresh start without reference to the solution. Then, maybe go out for a walk, after which go over the problem again.

#### Memory.
*Working memory* and *long term memory*.

Use the technique *spaced repitition* to move working memory to long-term memory.
