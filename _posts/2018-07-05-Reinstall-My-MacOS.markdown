(The content of the blog.)

Several things I will do in my blog:
* Try to illustrate what I have learnt to examine whether I truly understand it or not.
* Log down my puzzles and how I solve it.
* Record some interesting and happy moments in my daily life.

I have decided to learn photography from now on. Maybe I would pause playing softball for some period and photography would be my future hobby. I found it very interesting through several hours' learning. Hope all goes well!

Next time, before updating macOS, I need to backup all important files and bookmarks and mac configurations.

Tasks I have already done:
1. Upgrade my iCloud storage to 50GB. This experience reminds me of the great importance of backing up.
2. Softwares I installed: Wunderlist, Be Focused, Anaconda, Google Chrome, BaiduWangpan, Pycharm, Clion, VSCode, Cheatsheet, Shadowsocks, TexStudio, Texpad, Thunder, MacTex.(Installing only the latex platform is not enough, MacTex should be downloaded as well. MacTex is one of the most popular latex distribution on macOS. Before I reinstall the computer, I used TexShop. One more thing, it seems that TexShop is one component of MacTex.) 
3. Install homebrew using the code as follows:
> /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
While installing homebrew, it shows error message: *Failed during: git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/master --tags --force*. After searching Google, I found one [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39836190/homebrew-install-failed-during-git-fetch-origin-masterrefs-remotes-origin-mas). Hope this will help.
4. Install Microsoft Office:
First download the ISO file in the Baiduwangpan, then run the pkg installer file. After installing, just as before, Outlook cannot be used and an error message shows about version being too early. I googled this problem and found [Microsoft Support for macOS High Sierra](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Microsoft-Office-support-for-macOS-10-13-High-Sierra-80bbd3cc-2412-4593-988a-1c5607b26b28). According to the guidance, I downloaded the latest [Office 2016 for Mac Suite Installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=525133)

Tasks I need to do:
1. Softwares I need to install later: Firefox, Octave.

### To Use *Pycharm* and *Clion*, I need to sign in the Jetbrains website and use my account and password to activate these two softwares.
### To use Texpad, I need to sign in the TexPad website and use my email and password to activate the softwares.
