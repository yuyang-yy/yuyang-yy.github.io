This blog is the notes for the book: **Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware** by *Andy Hunt*.

## Tips

1. Always consider the context.
2. Rules for novices, intuition for experts.
3. Know what you don't know.
4. Learn by watching and imitating.
5. Keep practing in order to remain expert.
6. Avoid formal methods if you need creativity, intuition, or inventivenss.
7. Learn the skill of learning.

## Chapter 2

- Novices(rules) -> Advanced Beginners(no big picture) -> Competent(troubleshoot) -> Proficient(self-correct) -> Expert(intuition)
- Unskilled and unaware of it. In the contrary, an expert are always thinking about how little they know.

- Most people are just advanced beginners.

- Deliberate practice requires four conditions: 
    - A well-defined task.
    - The task should be challenging but doable.
    - An environment that supplies informative feedback that you can act on.
    - Opportunities for repitition and correction of errors.

- Take responsibilities. "I was just following orders!" doesn't work.
- Power of good examplars. Imitate -> Assimilate -> Innovate
- There is no expertise without experience.
- Again, context matters! "It depends." They are right.
- 

My thoughts:

- Regarding the statistical modelling course, I always asked for formal methods to a certain problem. The thing is: **Context**!
- Either when I try to understand STAT or MATH course, I neglect the intuitive understanding and always chase for the one-step-by-one-step proof. I need to focus more on intuition.

Next Actions:

- [ ] Rate yourself.
- [ ] Identify the levels of other skills.
- [ ] Decide what you need to do to advance these skills.
- [ ] Think of your teammates: Where are they on the journey? Hoa can that be helpful to you?
