## General Advice

1. Perseverence and avoiding procrastination would aid you a lot as you keep going forward. It's more a test of endurance rather than knowledge.

2. Keep track of things you do. Keep simple notes of everything you do and it would aid you while writing thesis.

3. Attend and present at as many conferences as possible. They stimulate new ways of looking at your research problems, ensure that you have up-to-date information, and help you to connect with other people who are interested in similar subjects.

4. Cooperate with somebody who is more experienced and skilled.

5. Work continuously in small steps.

6. Love the research.

7. Praise the failure and be courageous.

8. Learn time-management.

9. Have the big picture, know the whole research process.

10. Don't spoil your name by doing a crap work.

11. Leave academic and research world if you find out that it's not for you.

12. Keep motivated.

13. Communication skills.

14. Avoid ever thinking that you know more than the others.

15. Remember that researching always is researching what we don't know, thus critical thinking is more than a prerequisite. 

16. Dilligence.


## Time Management

1. Give yourself permission to make mistakes. Perfectionism will kill your creativity and productivity. Revising your draft several times is better than getting it done within the first try.

2. Try writing or reading in short sprints. Put your attention fully on writing for just 10-30 minutes.

3. Make a small spiral notebook your closet friend. Instead of acting on urgent to-do’s(emails or phone calls) right away, tuck them away safely in your little notebook, and attend to them after you have finished writing.

4. Don't get email and social media out of the way. When you begin your day by reading messages, you are prioritizing other people’s requests before taking action towards your long-term goals. Begin your day by doing the highest priority task, especially one that you have been putting off for a while.

5. Stop trying to please your supervisor. Focus on the end result they desire, not on trying to please him or her. When you focus on “looking smart”, rather than learning, you might not reach out for help when you need to.

6. When you catch yourself worrying, do something about it. Talk to someone. Once you identify the exact cause of your worrying, make a plan to either get your research back on track or to talk to your supervisor about next steps. 

7. Celebrate every day. We are so experienced at beating ourselves up, and feeling like failures if we don’t get through our to-do list or if we fall behind on our milestones. “The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.” - Oprah Winfrey. The next time you don’t get through your to-do list, treat yourself to a little treat (exercise, walk, dinner with friends), to celebrate what you have done.
