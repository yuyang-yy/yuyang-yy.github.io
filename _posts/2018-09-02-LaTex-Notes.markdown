## Learning Notes
Most of the latex notes are referenced in the book [LATEX Tutorials: A PRIMER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuyang-yy/materials/master/ltxprimer-1.0.pdf)


## Error Log
1. Use \\\\ in a seperate line, and error appears. Do not use two backslashes in one single line.

## Notes
1. There seems to be some difference between \\ and **enter**.
