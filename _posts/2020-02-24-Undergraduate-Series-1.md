This is the first post in the *Undergraduate Series*. I realized yesterday that I have met so many good friends up till now. And why not log our experience down? This is an invaluable asset for me, and every time I think of these, I feel happy from the bottom of my heart. Hope our story can bring happiness to you as well.

Yuji was one of my best friend during my undergraduate and our friendship doesn't fade with time and distance apart. We joined the college softball team in the same year; we played softball together for the whole four years in college; we lived in the same dormitory building; we did internship together. We supported each other, both in study and in life. I wrote an article about Yuji at undergrate graduation, and here is the [original link of our story](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fyh1VUFddU1tgHu1marvmQ). Note that this article is written in Chinese. Hope you like our story!
