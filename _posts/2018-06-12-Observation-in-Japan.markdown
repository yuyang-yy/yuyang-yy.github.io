The first day in Japan.

We arrived at Japan at about 3:40PM at local time zone. The first thing that I was amazed by is the toilet. Each room has a music player to counter the noise made. The paper is recycleable.

The picture is not taken yet. I would add it tomorrow. Tomorrow we would go to the USJ for fun. Hope all is well!
