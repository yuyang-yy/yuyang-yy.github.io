One of the main book I referred is [Github 入门与实践](https://book.douban.com/subject/26462816/).

### Work with Github and Multiple accounts
I configured this based on the [guidance](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574). Here is [another better instruction](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/manage-multiple-github-accounts-the-ssh-way-2dadc30ccaca).

1. Set the ssh for my personal github account.
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your github account email"

2. Add the id_rsa.pub file in the SSH of **Setting** on github website.

3. Connect using ssh key
> ssh -T git@github.com 

    In this step, an error message comes out to be **Permission denied**. To fix this problem, add the following content in the _config_ file. (If do not have a config file, just create one)
```
#Default GitHub
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hotmail  # may change the name of rsa
```
    Once again, 
> ssh -T git@github.com 

    and it works!

4. Add my UMN github account. Following the same procedure as above, then add the following content to the _config_ file.
```
#Default GitHub
Host github-UMN
  HostName github.umn.edu
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_UMN  
```
Then use the following command to connect using ssh.
> ssh -T git@github-UMN

5. To push the repository to the personal github account
> git init
>
> git commit -am "first commit"
>
> (contents of other commits) # remember this could not be empty, or errors would come out. You must have got something to commit.
> 
> git remote add origin git@github.com:username/test.git
> 
> git push -u origin master

    For work account, just replace **github.com** with **github-UMN** and change the corresponding username.


### Add the sharable download URL for files in Github.

Referenced from https://help.data.world/hc/en-us/articles/115006300048-GitHub-how-to-find-the-sharable-download-URL-for-files-on-GitHub.

Just use the following to format:
> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/branch/filename

### Upload files to Github

If a repository is empty, then files could not be uploaded. Either add a README.md, either commit for once.
