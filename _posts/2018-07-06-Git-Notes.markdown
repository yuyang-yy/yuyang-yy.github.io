After being confused by Git for almost 3 months, I have finally decided to write notes about Git to 
keep me familiar with Git and Github. These notes are acquired through reading [Github 入门与实践](https://book.douban.com/subject/26462816/).

### Work with Github and Multiple accounts
I configured this based on the [guidance](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574).

1. Set the ssh for my personal github account.
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your github account email"

2. Add the id_rsa.pub file in the SSH of **Setting** on github website.

3. Connect using ssh key
> ssh -T git@github.com 

In this step, an error message comes out to be **Permission denied**. To fix this problem, add the following content in the _config_ file. (If do not have a config file, just create one)
```
#Default GitHub
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hotmail  # may change the name of the rsa file
```
Once again, 
> ssh -T git@github.com 

and it works!

4. Add my UMN github account. Following the same procedure as above, then add the following content to the _config_ file.
```
#Default GitHub
Host github-UMN
  HostName github.umn.edu
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_UMN  
```
Then use the following command to connect using ssh.
> ssh -T git@github-UMN

5. To push the repository to the personal github account
> git init
>
> git commit -am "first commit"
>
> (contents of other commits) # remember this could not be empty, or errors would come out. You must have got something to commit.
> 
> git remote add origin git@github.com:username/test.git
> 
> git push -u origin master

For work account, just replace **github.com** with **github-UMN** and change the corresponding username.
