Today is filled with sweat and laughter. I, together with my dad, aunt, and my cousins, went to the Baimuyuan District in Tanqiu for a trip. The original purpose is to experience the drifting, but other interesting things were discovered. In a word, this is a happy trip.

Besides, one thing I forgot to mention in the previous blog: I have been practicing driving for nearly 15 days and now are somewhat familiar with driving. This is a relatively big progress. And today I drove the car to the resort.

In the morning, we walked through two suspension bridges, finished one jungle exploring project and boated on the lake. So much fun!

In the afternoon, after waiting for the drifting to begin for nearly one and a half hours, we, with great excitement, took on the drifting trip. I teamed with a boy, who is fairly interesting. The drifting trip with him turned out to be a happy one.

Trip is a good way to enhance relationships and build new ones.

Good night to me!
