Hi! I am Yu Yang, a second-year PhD student in Statistics. I am now working on natural language processing and some machine learning methods. 

This is my personal blog. I usually write notes in programming, system configuration, and course understanding. I may also share some of my little stories here. I would be happy if you enjoy this blog! You can also check my [academic website](https://yuyangstatistics.github.io/).

My motto is: *Respect Life!*
